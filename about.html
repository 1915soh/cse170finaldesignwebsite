            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>I found a deep love for crochet and wondered how long can I keep this up for? Due to this, I found that many experienced fatigue during long term sessions or even in the longer term. I wanted to create a handle that would allow for me to let other artists continue their passion as forever as one could. In addition, crochet is time consuming but it shouldn't consume so much space. I, thus, wanted a compact and variety of sizes which store easily and I can change out with ease. Therefore, I wanted to showcase a product that would solve these two issues of accessibility with comfortable grip, secure interchangeable heads, and pretty product design.</p>
